Contributing
================

First and foremost, thank you for your interest in contributing to gitbranchhealth! This is a small script, so there isn't a lot of work to do. That said, patches are accepted, so this just outlines our process for contributing.

General Development Process
----------------

In general, our process uses a branch-based approach to fixing issues. If you're interested in fixing a particular issue (or adding a new feature), it's best to follow this procedure:

1. File an issue (if one isn't already filed).
2. Fork the repository to your github account.
3. Create a branch for your development work: `git checkout -b issue-76`
4. Fix/add whatever you need.
  1. When you make commits, use the present-tense, imperative style for commit messages (indicate what you did, and why you did it), prefixed by the issue number (e.g. "Issue #87: Fix garbage collection so it doesn't collect as much garbage in order to prevent out of memory issues.").
  2. Try to make the first line of the commit message as short as possible, but feel free to add additional lines for more description.
  3. Make small commits frequently as you develop code that is self-contained and cohesive (this is the power of the branching model), rather than one large commit at the end.
  4. If this is your first patch, add one more commit that adds your name to the AUTHORS.md file.
5. Push your code to your repository fork.
6. Submit a pull request from your branch on your fork to origin/master on jwir3/gitbranchhealth.
  a. Generally, there might be a couple of review iterations, but almost all pull requests are accepted.

Contributor Agreement
----------------

By submitting a pull request, you agree to the following:

1. The code you submit is either your own code, which you developed and own, or every author of the code that you've compiled must agree to their code being distributed under the license of gitbranchhealth.
2. The code contained in the pull request will be distributed under the license specified in LICENSE.md. You unconditionally transfer all rights to this code to the gitbranchhealth administrators, without exception, under this license, and agree that at some future date, if the license should change to another open source license (not to a commercial or proprietary license), you will agree to your code being included under this new license.
3. As a contributor, you should be willing to answer questions and facilitate discussion brought up by both users of the software and other contributors, within a reasonable timeframe. It's not expected that you never leave the project or that you answer questions that aren't related to the work that you performed, but it is expected that you will be responsive and helpful, to the best of your ability, to new contributers and users of the software.

Questions/Concerns/Issues
----------------

github is a collaborative environment. That's what makes it powerful. If you have a question about gitbranchhealth, you can get it answered in any of the following ways:

1. Submit an issue and tag it with the 'question' label.
2. If you know the developer (via blame or some other method) who developed the code you have a question on, you can email them directly.
3. You can email the project administrator, Scott at jaywir3{at}gmail.com.
